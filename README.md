# algojs
A js app to visualize algorithms. Each algorithm starts with a default set of data
and the user can make sequential passes in the algorithm to see how the data is processed
at each step.

## Parts:
- list algorithms on the left 
- algorithm display on the right:
    - see the last two steps in the algorithm process
    - data display , textual display of organization of key data in the algorithm
    - graph display **TODO** visual representation of data
    - buttons to step forward and backward in the process or to automate the running of the 
    process. 
    
## local testing
* cd into algoapp
* ng serve --open

## TODOS
* clear up errors in build
* revisit quick sort visualization and example
* revisit A* visiulation and example
* create 3d rendering and web worker example (john resig)
* create views for different size screens
* create a machine learning algorithm
* create a visual algorithm to turn a circle in to a square (like flash)
