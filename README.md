# algojs
A js app to visualize algorithms. Each algorithm starts with a default set of data
and the user can make sequential passes in the algorithm to see how the data is processed
at each step.

## Parts:
* list algorithms on the left 
* algorithm display on the right:
    * see the last two steps in the algorithm process
    * data display , texetual display of organization of key data in the algorithm
    * graph display **TODO** visual representation of data
    * buttons to step forward and backward in the process or to automate the running of the 
    process.
